# Tidebreaker — Table 2 design brief

**Status: v1 built (2026-07-05).** `playfield.svg` + `rules.json` +
`src/table/defs/tidebreaker.ts` are now the specifics; this brief remains
the design intent. Deltas from the concept, found during clearance-solving
and simcheck/soak:

- **The airlock moved.** A mid-field diagonal bank sat inside the winch
  ramp's corridor (every bank shot tripped the ramp's layer sensor), and a
  free-standing staircase housing could not be sealed against the ball-gap
  rules. v1 recesses the three hatch-bolt targets into the orbit wall's
  field face (left side, faces pointing right, Moondial's proven housing
  pattern mirrored) — an intentional **right-flipper cross-field shot**.
  Flipper jobs became: left = trench mouth + dive bell; right = winch ramp
  (straight up) + airlock (cross-field).
- **The Raised Deck was cut** per §7's cut line (no mini-flipper or
  diverter in v1); the height centrepiece is the ramp + habitrail circuit.
- **Real outlanes were engineered in** (the Moondial funnel seals its
  corners): outlane guide walls at x=52/470 with 40 mm channels, plus a
  deflector off the left shell so Current exits can't feed the outlane.
- **`data-up-only`** was added to the layer-switch convention after soak
  found stray balls crossing the ramp-entry zone sideways becoming
  wrong-layer ghosts (STYLE-GUIDE §4).

**Premise:** a salvage diver works a single dive down an abyssal trench to a
wreck on the seafloor. The tall scrolling playfield *is* the trench — the
top of the table is the moonlit surface rig, the bottom is the wreck. You
dive with your eyes (the art darkens with depth); you score by hauling
salvage *up* (the shots go up-table). The drain is losing the ball into the
trench.

Where Moondial is quiet, cool, and celestial, Tidebreaker is pressurised,
kinetic, and warm-lit-in-the-dark. Same night, other side of the horizon:
the surface swell at the top of the playfield sits under the same moon
Moondial is watching.

## 1. The three strata (height without 3D physics)

Physics stays planar (plan §7). Height is a **collision-layer + render**
trick, standardised in STYLE-GUIDE.md §4 ("Layers & height"):

| Stratum | `data-layer` | Fiction | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Rig | `1` | deck + cable gantries above the water | raised deck, winch ramp, habitrail return |
| The Water | `0` | main playfield | everything conventional |
| The Trench | `-1` | tunnels under the playfield | trench-mouth subway, trench-gutter subway |

Each stratum is a planar collision set; `sensor-ramp-entry/exit` sensors
switch the ball's layer, and `height-profile-*` paths tell the renderers
how high/deep to draw the ball. One ball, one Planck world, one layer
active at a time.

## 2. Layout

Playfield `0..520`, plunger lane `520..575` (fiction: the **descent
shaft** — originally labelled "moon pool", the real diving term, but in a
game whose other table is MOONDIAL it read as theme bleed). Deliberately **asymmetric**
interior (STYLE-GUIDE §3, as amended): the two flippers have different
jobs, which is what makes the table shoot differently from Moondial.

Zone by zone, top to bottom (y-ranges indicative — final geometry is set in
the SVG under the ball-gap invariants, which apply **per layer**):

- **The surface (y ≈ 0–240).** Full-height orbit along both walls — **the
  Current** — plunger feeding into it. Four **D-I-V-E** rollover lanes
  (~y 90), three **sonar buoy** bumpers below. Conventional on purpose: the
  player starts each ball in familiar territory and the strangeness
  increases with depth, same as the fiction.
- **The Winch Ramp (right-centre, entry ~(330, 620), layer 0→1).** The
  signature *up* shot, from the right flipper. A **spinner at the ramp
  entry** — ripping the ramp is reeling the winch. Climbs (+1) to a crest
  beside the rollovers, returns via a **habitrail** down the left wall
  (styled as the winch-cable gantry) into the left inlane. The repeatable
  flow loop: right flipper → ramp → left inlane → right flipper.
- **The Raised Deck (upper-left, ~x 60–200 / y 200–330, layer 1).** The
  height centrepiece: a small elevated rig deck reached from the winch ramp
  when a **diverter** is lit. Carries a **third mini-flipper**
  (`anchor-flipper-upper`) and one standing target (the crane control) —
  making the deck shot lights the Dive Bell's biggest hauls. The ball
  leaves by rolling off the deck's open **drop edge**: the deck's collision
  chains exist only on layer 1, so crossing the lip switches the ball to
  layer 0 and it falls back into the mid-table (the 3D renderer plays the
  drop for real). **Designated cut line — see §7.**
- **The Trench Mouth (centre-left, ~(180, 430), layer 0→−1).** The
  signature *down* shot, from the left flipper: the ball visibly sinks
  under the playfield and travels a real walled subway channel on layer −1
  beneath the airlock — glimpsed through two porthole grates cut into the
  art — before the Dive Bell kicker fires it back onto layer 0. Every
  transit runs the DMD depth-ticker.
- **The Airlock (mid-table, ~(300, 480)).** The 3-target drop bank, angled
  to face the **left** flipper. Three targets = three hatch bolts; a
  completed bank cycles the airlock and lights the **Dive Bell** scoop
  tucked behind it (~(370, 420)).
- **The gutters (bottom).** Standard sling/inlane/outlane trapezoid, both
  outlanes active:
  - **Left outlane — Escape Hatch:** a kickback (Kicker entity, firing up),
    lit by completing D-I-V-E. Fiction: emergency ballast blow.
  - **Right outlane — Trench Gutter:** feeds a layer −1 subway that carries
    the ball under the flippers and ejects from the Escape Hatch position —
    but **only when lit** (light it at the Dive Bell). Unlit, the subway
    routes to the drain. An outlane that is sometimes the best thing that
    can happen to you.

**Flipper roles:** right flipper owns the winch ramp (haul); left flipper
owns the airlock and trench mouth (dive); the mini-flipper owns the crane
target. This division is the layout's identity — preserve it through any
geometry changes.

## 3. Rules skeleton

Same `rules.json` shape as Moondial (base points + bonus units + a combo +
a scoop ladder + a wizard mode). Values below are starting guesses for
tuning, not commitments:

- **The Current (orbit combo):** repeat loops inside a 10 s window step the
  combo (max 3), each step ticking the DMD depth readout deeper.
- **Depth gauge (bonus multiplier — the moon-phase sibling):** completing
  D-I-V-E advances one stage — `100m / 300m / 600m / 1000m / TRENCH FLOOR`
  — each a bonus-X step with its own insert lamp running down the
  playfield centreline: a literal gauge the player descends.
- **Salvage hauls (Dive Bell ladder, wrapping, like Moondial's
  `telescope.sightings`):** `BRASS COMPASS 5,000 → CARGO CRATE 10,000 →
  CAPTAIN'S SAFE 15,000 → THE MOTHERLODE 25,000`; the last spots progress
  toward LEVIATHAN. The crane-control target (deck) upgrades the next haul.
- **LEVIATHAN (wizard mode):** qualify by reaching TRENCH FLOOR **and**
  completing 2 airlock cycles. 25 s: all switches ×2, the Current pays
  jackpot value, DMD plays the leviathan pass.
- **Escape Hatch:** kickback lit per D-I-V-E completion (one save).
  **Trench Gutter:** lit at the Dive Bell; unlit = drain.

## 4. Palette & style (pending style-guide amendment)

Feature colour: **cyan** (already in the neon family — bioluminescence is
what cyan-on-dark-field is for), with restrained magenta for deep-sea
creature accents. Brass stays on what the ball touches (flippers, winch,
dive-bell rim); violet remains the shared logo-glow signature.

The one *proposed* addition: an **abyssal field variant** — a blue-green
cast of the `field` ramp so the trench darkens teal rather than Moondial's
blue-violet. Token values to be authored in Claude Design and added to
`tokens.css` + STYLE-GUIDE §2 **before** any playfield art is drawn (per
the guide's own rule). No other new hexes anticipated.

Art gradient down the table: moonlit swell → sunlit water → twilight zone →
bioluminescent abyss → the wreck at the slings. Printed-art desaturation,
key light, and ink rules per the guide as usual.

## 5. DMD scenes (masters in `design/dmd-scenes/`, baked as always)

1. **Descent ticker** — depth gauge counting down between events.
2. **Winch haul** — crate rising on a cable, for spinner rips and hauls.
3. **Airlock cycle** — hatch wheel spin, bolts lighting.
4. **Sonar ping** — expanding circle wipe; doubles as mode-start transition.
5. **Leviathan pass** — a tail, then an eye, past the dive-bell porthole;
   never the whole creature. Worth the most frames.

The amber DMD reads as a sonar/instrument display here — it is diegetically
the dive bell's console.

## 6. Audio direction

ChipMusic brief: sparse low-tempo bassline around a sonar-ping motif (one
high square-wave blip, long delay); density/tempo layer up as the depth
gauge advances. LEVIATHAN drops the melody: sub-bass + the ping at half
speed. SFX: bumpers = pings at different pitches, spinner = ratcheting
reel, scoop = hatch clunk + pressure hiss, kickback = ballast blast,
tilt = hull groan.

## 7. Engine requirements & cut line

In build order (this is the M10 code track):

1. **Collision layers** — `data-layer` in `SvgCollision.ts` → Planck filter
   bits; ramp-entry/exit sensors flip the ball's mask. Enables everything.
2. **Render height profiles** — `height-profile-*` paths; 3D lifts/sinks
   the ball, 2D fakes it (draw order, slight scale, shadow offset).
3. **Third flipper** — `anchor-flipper-upper` + an upper-flipper binding in
   `Input` (traditionally shares the right flipper key).
4. **Diverter** — one small gate entity, open/closed by game state.
5. Kickback + subways — existing `Kicker.ts` + sensors.

**Cut line:** if the Raised Deck fights back, ship it as art + a standing
target reached from the ramp (no mini-flipper, no diverter, no drop edge)
and add the flipper in a table v2. Everything else is sensor-and-layer
work.

## 8. Authoring order & verification

Theme brief (this file) → style-guide/token amendment → playfield SVG
master → rules.json → DMD scenes → logo/backglass. Simcheck + soak after
every playfield-SVG edit, as always — both need to understand layers well
enough to flag a ball trapped in a subway, and the ball-gap invariants are
checked per layer.
